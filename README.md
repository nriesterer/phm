Probability Heuristics Model
============================

The Probability Heuristics Model (PHM) is a model formalization of the probabilistic cognitive theory on human reasoning. The goal of this repository is to provide a general implementation of the formalism as described in the introductory articles:

> Chater, N., & Oaksford, M. (1999). The probability heuristics model of syllogistic reasoning. Cognitive psychology, 38(2), 191-258.
>
> Oaksford, M., & Chater, N. (2001). The probabilistic approach to human reasoning. Trends in cognitive sciences, 5(8), 349-357.

### Repository Content

- `phm`: Source code directory for the Python-based PHM implementation.

### Requirements

- Python 3
